# Adult-Income-Prediction-Using-ML
This project predicts whether a person’s income is greater than or less than $50K per year using Machine Learning models.
The dataset used is the Adult Income (Census Income Dataset).

📌 Project Goals:
  Understand dataset and clean missing values
  Apply machine learning classification models
  Compare model performance using metrics & visualizations
  Identify the best model for income prediction

🛠 Models Used:
  Logistic Regression
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📊 Evaluation Metrics:
  Accuracy
  Precision
  Recall
  Confusion Matrix
  Comparison bar chart for all models
  
📈 Visualizations Included:
  Correlation heatmap
  Confusion matrices (subplot for all models)
  Clustered bar graph comparing Accuracy, Precision, Recall
